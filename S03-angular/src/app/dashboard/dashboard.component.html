      <h2>Innovations in Clean Energy</h2>
      <p>
          From 2014 to 2023, America significantly expanded its production of solar, wind, and geothermal power, with all 50 states contributing to a tripling in capacity. The "Renewables on the Rise 2024" report illuminates the substantial progress made, demonstrating that solar energy now powers 22 million homes, an eightfold increase from 2014, and wind energy generation has more than doubled, now capable of powering nearly 39 million homes. Battery storage capacity reached a remarkable 15.5 gigawatts by the end of 2023, up from just 0.16 gigawatts in 2014, facilitating greater utilization of renewable sources and providing stability during extreme weather and high grid stress.

          The electrification of the transportation sector has also seen dramatic growth, with the number of electric vehicles (EVs) increasing to 3.3 million, a 25-fold increase from 2014, and supported by nearly 176,000 EV charging ports, a significant rise from around 25,143 in 2014. Energy efficiency initiatives continue to show benefits, with improvements made in 2022 expected to save enough energy to power 25 million homes for a year.

          However, increasing demands from expanding data centers and AI technologies are driving up electricity consumption, challenging the push towards 100% renewable energy by 2045. This burgeoning demand risks reviving the use of coal, gas, and nuclear power, complicating efforts to sustain a clean energy transition. The report underscores the necessity of enhancing energy conservation and efficiency, stressing that a holistic approach to energy management is crucial for achieving environmental sustainability and meeting the visionary goal of a fully renewable energy future.

      <h2>Technical Aspects of the Application</h2>
      <p>
          This project leverages a full-stack JavaScript environment, utilizing Angular for the frontend, Node.js for the server-side operations, and MySQL for database management. Angular's robust framework enables dynamic data binding and modular application structure, enhancing user interface interactions. Node.js offers an efficient, event-driven runtime for the backend, handling API requests and data processing with non-blocking I/O operations. MySQL serves as a reliable relational database management system, storing and retrieving data for real-time and historical energy usage and analytics. Together, these technologies create a scalable, responsive application capable of managing complex data flows and user interactions in real-time.
